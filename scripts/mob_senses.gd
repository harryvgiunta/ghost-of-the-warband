## Aggression and sight for every wilderness mob.
##
## One rule set for the profile state machines (devils, forest mobs) and the
## legacy wolf/sentinel/cinder devil AI:
##
##   - A mob is aggressive only while it has seen a ranger recently. Sight is
##     a forward cone, capped by the profile's range, and blocked by terrain,
##     props and tree trunks. A mob's back is blind, so a ranger can walk up
##     behind it and strike unseen.
##   - Losing the line of sight never drops aggression. The mob keeps hunting
##     the last place it saw its quarry for `MEMORY_SECONDS` (15 s, the
##     required floor) and only then walks home.
##   - A landed blow always gives a mob the fight: `notice()` on any damage
##     path, plus `alert_pack()` so the neighbours that heard the cry join.
##
## Every mob joins `GROUP`; that is the only thing alerting needs. Senses are
## host-side gameplay state: replicas replay a snapshot and never run this.

## Ranges shared by every mob family.
const GROUP := "wild_mobs"
## Seconds of pursuit from the last sighting. The requirement is "at least 15
## seconds", so this is the floor and never an instant reset.
const MEMORY_SECONDS := 15.0

const HALF_FOV_DEGREES := 70.0
## A struck mob's cry reaches this far, so a pack answers as one.

## The town's safe ring. Mobs never hunt a ranger standing inside it.
