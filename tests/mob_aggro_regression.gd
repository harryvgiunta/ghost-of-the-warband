## Owns the contract the feature was asked for: a mob only hunts what it can
## actually see (forward cone, capped range, scenery blocks it), a ranger can
## stand behind it safely, a landed blow makes it turn on its attacker and
## pulls the neighbours in, and losing sight never resets aggression before
## `MEMORY_SECONDS` (15 s) have passed.
